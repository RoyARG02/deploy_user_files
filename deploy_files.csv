### The list of files and the locations they should be copied to.
###
### Each line below specifies the files to be copied by this order:
###
### <name of the file in "./files" folder>,<name to be copied as>,<location(s) to be copied to>
###
### For instance, ".bashrc" for the root user is defined below as:
###
### .rootbashrc,.bashrc,/root
###
### If the file is copied as the same name in this repo, the same name is
### repeated twice. See the line to copy ".bashrc" file for an example.
###
### If any file is to be copied to multiple locations, name them one after the
### other at the end of the line. All locations will have the file with the
### same name, so if different file names are desired, specify them in
### different lines.
###
### It is preferable to define the location of the file as an absolute path,
### but "~" can be used to represent the user home directory.
###
### Copying any file in this list can be skipped by appending a '#' in front of
### the line, or by deleting them altogether.
