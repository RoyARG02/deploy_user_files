### The list of files and the locations they should be
### copied to.
###
### The files are listed in this order:
###
### <name of the file in this folder>    <name to be copied as>    <location to be copied to>
###
### For instance, ".bashrc" for the root user is defined below as:
###
### <.rootbashrc>    <.bashrc>    </root>
###
### "Name to be copied as" can be omitted. In that case,
### the name of the file in this folder is used. See the
### line to copy ".bashrc" file for an example.
###
### Multiple locations can be defined for the file to be
### copied to multiple locations with the same name. If
### different file names are required, define them in
### separate lines.
###
### It's preferable to define the location of the file as
### an absolute path.
###
### Copying any file in this list can be skipped by
### appending a '#' in front of the line, or by deleting
### them altogether.
